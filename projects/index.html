      repo list</a></p><h2>LADXR Spoiler Log Interface</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-9"><h3>What is this?</h3><p>So you might have heard of game randomizers. And you might have heard of Legend of Zelda Link's
          Awakening.</p><p>If both, you might want to check out LADXR, a randomizer for Link's Awakening.</p><p>When you create a ROM, you can also create a spoiler log. This can be in JSON - and this JSON can be read
          by the LADXR Spoiler Interface!</p></div><div class="col-3"><h3>Website</h3><p>There is an online version available:
          <a href="/ladxr-spoiler-interface/" target="_blank">LADXR Spoiler Log Interface</a></p></div></div></section><section><h2>Dice Rollers</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-9"><h3>What is this?</h3><p>In the rules of tabletop games, dice rolls follow a specific notation. What I wanted to do was to take this
          notation (even in complicated cases), parse the input and use RNG to &quot;roll&quot; the dice. That way, I could keep
          my big
          dice bag at home while playing D&amp;D - because I had the laptop on the table already because I didn't want to
          use paper based
          charsheets and stuff like that.</p><p>The first version was built in AngularJS, then an Angular (2+) version followed. Since then, building a
          dice roller is often my &quot;hello world&quot; for a new frontend technology. The most current ready one is built in
          Vue.</p></div><div class="col-3"><h3>Website</h3><ul><li>AngularJS: Doesn't exist anymore, because AngularJS is a dead technology.</li><li>
            Angular:

            Vue:

            Svelte: Not usable. Very much not usable at the moment. The dice roller, not Svelte :D
          </li><li>
            React: I thought I had a react version, but there is no repository. But there will be a version!
          </li></ul></div></div></section><section><h2>D&amp;D Initiative Tool</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-9"><h3>What is this?</h3><p>Another thing for my D&amp;D playing and dungeon mastering. When duing combat,
          the participants are put in order by their initiative and act in order. And there
          are possibilities to change the order. I was too lazy to think about some way
          to keep track of everything on paper, and also the players need to see the initative.</p><p>The idea is to have this initiative tracker. And maybe have some kind of websocket
          connection for players with mobiles/laptops (TODO: Develop)</p><p>And for the vue edition I try to build a DM helper version which keeps track of the
          characters in groups (with dates we are playing) and some of their stats. And notes for
          the monsters. And maybe an integration with the dice roller. But I keep doing too complex
          stuff and fail building a working tool...</p></div><div class="col-3"><h3>Website</h3><ul><li>React:
            <a href="/initiative-react/" target="_blank">Initiative React</a></li><li>
            Vue: Not ready to be shown yet.
          </li></ul></div></div></section><section><h2>Other work (e.g. for punkt.de)</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-9"><h3>Codeception packages</h3><p>At work, we tend do write automatic behaviour/frontend tests with codeception, and we
          like to use the Gherkin syntax to be forced to write easy understandable steps for complex
          tests.</p><p>When we started using this, we put the necessary steps within the test project, but that
          way we couldn't reuse them (other than copying, which would mean we lose newer developments
          in older projects). So I did what every open source dev does and created repositories for
          different codeception modules which extend them and implements gherkin steps.</p></div><div class="col-3"><h3>Website</h3><p>Because there are many packages, so let's just do the
          <a href="https://github.com/orgs/punktDe/repositories?q=codeception&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=" target="_blank">link to the repo search
          </a>
          .
        </p></div></div><h3>Others</h3><p>Other than that, I help working on different open source packages and extensions for customer projects.
      You can check out the repo list of
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/punktDe/repositories" target="_blank">punktDe</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/punktDeForks/repositories" target="_blank">punktDeForks</a> to check out
      some
      of those.
