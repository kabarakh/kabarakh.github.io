Or Herbie. Or Christian.</p><p data-v-e5c66bea>I&#39;ve been a &quot;real&quot; developer since 2009. Before that, I did some scripting for mIRC and tried to figure out how real programming with data storage and structure really works. Then I got my abitur and learned to be a glorious &quot;Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung&quot; - which is a mouthful for &quot;I know how to do this, but I don&#39;t have a diploma or similar&quot;.</p><p data-v-e5c66bea>Web technologies are what really is my bread and butter - I often tell people that when I try out something new and I read the docs and try it in a small project, that it immediately feels as if I were within my comfort zone.</p><h2 data-v-e5c66bea>punkt.de</h2><p data-v-e5c66bea>Since 2011 I&#39;ve been working at punkt.de in Karlsruhe. We were a TYPO3 agency, but in the meantime it&#39;s more like &quot;you like web? Let&#39;s do it!&quot;</p><p data-v-e5c66bea>We do all kinds of projects. Personally I was caught up in a project since 2012, which was fine because we got to try out new things, but also was bad because I had to keep developing for Internet Explorer 11... </p><p data-v-e5c66bea>In the meantime I am working on other, newer projects including headless CMS, modern CSS layouts and other cool stuff.</p></div><div class="col-3"><img alt="Picture of Kabarakh during a presentation" src="/assets/me_talk.a5ba446a.png" data-v-e5c66bea></div></div><footer><div id="nav"><a href="/imprint" class="">Imprint</a></div></footer></div>
