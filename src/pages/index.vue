  <h1>Welcome to my small github overview page</h1>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>The name's Kabarakh. Or Herbie. Or Christian.</p>
  <p>I've been a "real" developer since 2009. Before that, I did some scripting for mIRC and tried
    to figure out how real programming with data storage and structure really works. Then I got my abitur
    and learned to be a glorious "Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung" - which is a mouthful for "I know
    how to do this, but I don't have a diploma or similar".</p>
  <p>Web technologies are what really is my bread and butter - I often tell people that when I try out
    something new and I read the docs and try it in a small project, that it immediately feels as if I were
    within my comfort zone.</p>
  <h2>punkt.de</h2>
  <p>Since 2011 I've been working at punkt.de in Karlsruhe. We were a TYPO3 agency, but in the meantime it's
    more like "you like web? Let's do it!"</p>
  <p>We do all kinds of projects. Personally I was caught up in a project since 2012, which was fine because
    we got to try out new things, but also was bad because I had to keep developing for Internet Explorer 11...
  </p>
  <p>In the meantime I am working on other, newer projects including headless CMS, modern CSS layouts and other
    cool stuff.</p>
