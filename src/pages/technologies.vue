    <h1>Technologies I use</h1>
    <p>... and I like to mention or explain. Thing is, that I am oftentimes the guy at work who just jumps into any
      bug and who tries to find out what the problem is, no matter the technology it's in. So I get to know a quite
      high amount of them, and after a not so long time they usually feel quite good to use.</p>
    <h2>PHP</h2>
    <p>One of the big ones. Most code I have written is in php. We are using php based CMSs, we are using php based
      database abstraction layers and shops, it's just the most used language here.</p>
    <p>One big thing to mention - this whole "ugh php code is so ugly and mixes HTML and code, and classes are bad" is
      an old meme coming from php version 4 (released between 2000 and 2005 - I was still at school at that time!).
      Starting from php 5, the code is quite nice and every version improves it even more.</p>
    <p>I very much like to do MVC programming, and for that I use the frameworks bundled with the CMSs we use. So more
      on them later.</p>
