    <h3>Typescript and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>The next big ones for me. Most of the projects here are in these guys. I just love writing some lines of code,
      and then you go to the browser and see stuff happening.</p>
    <p>Same as php, JavaScript got kind of a reputation. Same thing applies here - yes, there are quirks and bad code.
      But especially with the new language features and by checking your code you can also write quite cool stuff which
      can be easily understood.</p>
    <p>TypeScript helps there, because variables are typed and you won't just have a string and an integer added
      together without having to make sure if you want mathematical addition or string concatenation. Considering this
      is one of the things most often criticized about JS, using TypeScript is a really important thing.</p>
